## Barn Submission
1. build singularity container using

```sudo singularity build --notest nav_competition_image.sif Singularityfile.def```

2. Run with

```./singularity_run.sh nav_competition_image.sif python3 run.py --world_idx 0```

Although run.py is in the `scripts/` folder, I've setup the `singularity_run.sh` script to keep the original commands.
